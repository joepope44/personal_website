I haved worked at :television: MTV Networks, DoubleVerify, various other ad tech and :digital: digital media networks and agencies, and the :basketball: NBA. I know python, pandas and scikit-learn well from my time studying at Metis, an immersive three-month data science boot camp. At the NBA, I used R, SQL and Tableau every day to bring actionable business insights to a variety of constituents and stakeholders. 

I have built numerous machine learning models and virtually every type of visualization available using ggplot. I am always eager to learn more. 

In my spare time you can find me playing :guitar: blues guitar, coding, or leveling up my machine learning skills.
